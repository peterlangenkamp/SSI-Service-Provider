# SSI Service Provider â€” Working with credentials made easy
Do you want to issue or verify credentials, but lack either the time, manpower, interest, or experience to implement this yourself? Or do you simply want to avoid the hastle of implementing support for multiple different wallets, and dealing with (breaking) changes on their end? Then you may want to consider our SSI service!

> The SSI Service Provider strives to improve the usability of SSI in real life by providing basic functionality that assists in issuing and verifying credentials to and from multiple wallets.

Similar to a payment service provider allowing webshops to easilly support payment with MasterCard, Visa, PayPal, iDeal, bitcoin, and you name it, our objective is to faciliatate issuing and verifying to and from any of the popular SSI wallets. We currently support IRMA, Jolocom, and (almost done!) Hyperledger Indy, with more to come.
